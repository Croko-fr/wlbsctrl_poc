# wlbsctrl_poc

## Description

This is a simple C++ POC to demonstrate how DLL hijacking can be leveraged against the IKEEXT service to execute commands remotely. This project simply adds a new user called demo to the computer's users.

One could instead implement malicious logic to run shellcode, for example, instead of adding a local user to facilitate lateral movement.
